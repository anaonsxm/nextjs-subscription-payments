## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](./public/architecture_diagram.png)

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anaonsxm/nextjs-subscription-payments.git
   cd nextjs-subscription-payments
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in your Supabase and Stripe credentials in `.env.local`

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The Vercel Deployment will create a new repository with this template on your GitHub account and guide you through a new Supabase project creation. The [Supabase Vercel Deploy Integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/supabase) will set up the necessary Supabase environment variables and run the [SQL migrations](./supabase/migrations/20230530034630_init.sql) to set up the Database schema on your account. You can inspect the created tables in your project's [Table editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/editor).

Should the automatic setup fail, please [create a Supabase account](https://app.supabase.com/projects), and a new project if needed. In your project, navigate to the [SQL editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql) and select the "Stripe Subscriptions" starter template from the Quick start section.

### Configure Auth

Follow [this guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github) to set up an OAuth app with GitHub and configure Supabase to use it as an auth provider.

In your Supabase project, navigate to [auth > URL configuration](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/url-configuration) and set your main production URL (e.g. https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app) as the site url.

Next, in your Vercel deployment settings, add a new **Production** environment variable called `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and set it to the same URL. Make sure to deselect preview and development environments to make sure that preview branches and local development work correctly.

#### [Optional] - Set up redirect wildcards for deploy previews (not needed if you installed via the Deploy Button)

If you've deployed this template via the "Deploy to Vercel" button above, you can skip this step. The Supabase Vercel Integration will have set redirect wildcards for you. You can check this by going to your Supabase [auth settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/url-configuration) and you should see a list of redirects under "Redirect URLs".

Otherwise, for auth redirects (email confirmations, magic links, OAuth providers) to work correctly in deploy previews, navigate to the [auth settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/url-configuration) and add the following wildcard URL to "Redirect URLs": `https://*-username.vercel.app/**`. You can read more about redirect wildcard patterns in the [docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#redirect-urls-and-wildcards).

If you've deployed this template via the "Deploy to Vercel" button above, you can skip this step. The Supabase Vercel Integration will have run database migrations for you. You can check this by going to [the Table Editor for your Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/editor), and confirming there are tables with seed data.

Otherwise, navigate to the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new), paste the contents of [the Supabase `schema.sql` file](./schema.sql), and click RUN to initialize the database.

#### [Maybe Optional] - Set up Supabase environment variables (not needed if you installed via the Deploy Button)

If you've deployed this template via the "Deploy to Vercel" button above, you can skip this step. The Supabase Vercel Integration will have set your environment variables for you. You can check this by going to your Vercel project settings, and clicking on 'Environment variables', there will be a list of environment variables with the Supabase icon displayed next to them.

Otherwise navigate to the [API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api) and paste them into the Vercel deployment interface. Copy project API keys and paste into the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` fields, and copy the project URL and paste to Vercel as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`.

Congrats, this completes the Supabase setup, almost there!

### Configure Stripe

Next, we'll need to configure [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to handle test payments. If you don't already have a Stripe account, create one now.

For the following steps, make sure you have the ["Test Mode" toggle](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) switched on.

#### Create a Webhook

We need to create a webhook in the `Developers` section of Stripe. Pictured in the architecture diagram above, this webhook is the piece that connects Stripe to your Vercel Serverless Functions.

1. Click the "Add Endpoint" button on the [test Endpoints page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks).
1. Enter your production deployment URL followed by `/api/webhooks` for the endpoint URL. (e.g. `https://your-deployment-url.vercel.app/api/webhooks`)
1. Click `Select events` under the `Select events to listen to` heading.
1. Click `Select all events` in the `Select events to send` section.
1. Copy `Signing secret` as we'll need that in the next step (e.g `whsec_xxx`) (/!\ be careful not to copy the webook id we_xxxx).
1. In addition to the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` we've set earlier during deployment, we need to add the webhook secret as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var.

#### Redeploy with new env vars

For the newly set environment variables to take effect and everything to work together correctly, we need to redeploy our app in Vercel. In your Vercel Dashboard, navigate to deployments, click the overflow menu button and select "Redeploy" (do NOT enable the "Use existing Build Cache" option). Once Vercel has rebuilt and redeployed your app, you're ready to set up your products and prices.

#### Create product and pricing information

Your application's webhook listens for product updates on Stripe and automatically propagates them to your Supabase database. So with your webhook listener running, you can now create your product and pricing information in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products).

Stripe Checkout currently supports pricing that bills a predefined amount at a specific interval. More complex plans (e.g., different pricing tiers or seats) are not yet supported.

For example, you can create business models with different pricing tiers, e.g.:

- Product 1: Hobby
  - Price 1: 10 USD per month
  - Price 2: 100 USD per year
- Product 2: Freelancer
  - Price 1: 20 USD per month
  - Price 2: 200 USD per year

Optionally, to speed up the setup, we have added a [fixtures file](fixtures/stripe-fixtures.json) to bootstrap test product and pricing data in your Stripe account. The [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install) `fixtures` command executes a series of API requests defined in this JSON file. Simply run `stripe fixtures fixtures/stripe-fixtures.json`.

**Important:** Make sure that you've configured your Stripe webhook correctly and redeployed with all needed environment variables.

#### Configure the Stripe customer portal

1. Set your custom branding in the [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)
1. Configure the Customer Portal [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal)
1. Toggle on "Allow customers to update their payment methods"
1. Toggle on "Allow customers to update subscriptions"
1. Toggle on "Allow customers to cancel subscriptions"
1. Add the products and prices that you want
1. Set up the required business information and links

### That's it

I know, that was quite a lot to get through, but it's worth it. You're now ready to earn recurring revenue from your customers. ðŸ¥³

### Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` should look like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Supabase
